# Week 3 Part 2

## Security

### Authorization

To improve our security, we should not let anyone to access our admin page. We should give each user a `role` which can tell you its authority. In our website, we only need to set 2 `roles` which are `user` and `admin`. Set the `role` of your own account to be `admin` and set other accounts to be `user`.

When a user access the admin pages, there will be 3 situations.

1. User not sign in.
2. User already sign in but its role is not `admin`.
3. User already sign in and have `admin` role.

We should only allow the last one to access our 3 admin pages.

- **/admin/product.html** for product management.
- **/admin/campaign.html** for campaign management.
- **/admin/checkout.html** for check out testing.

### Advanced Optional

There are three common authorization designs:

- ACL: Access Control List
- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control
- ABAC: Attribute-Based Access Control

Let's try to implement RBAC in your `stylish`.
