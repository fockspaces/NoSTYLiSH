# Week 3 Part 3

## Rate limiter

Sometimes, there will be malicious users who attack (or crawl) our website by firing thousands of requests within a short time window and crash your server.

We can build a `rate limiter` to prevent this kind of attacks. The basic idea is tracking the `ip` of each requests and only allow each ip address to request our website `N` times within `M` seconds. How to choose N, M properly is a hard question, but let's set them to be `N=10` and `M=1` for practice today.

You can set smaller `N` for manual testing.

You also need to think a reasonable way to test your rate limiter.

## Advanced Optional

1. There are many different kinds of rate limiters, look at each of them carefully and decide which one suit you best.
2. What if the malicious user change his/her ip address all the time?
