### Build User Sign In APIs

#### Integrate Facebook Login

Login with Facebook is a popular authorization mechanisom in modern websites. You should support Facebook Login from backend aspect. Check following steps for standard procedure of Facebook Login:

1. User will login with facebook in the front end.
2. Front End will get an **facebook access token** from Facebook server.
3. Front End should send this **facebook access token** to User Sign In API supported by backend.
4. Backend should use received **facebook access token** to call **Facebook Graph API** for user profile.
5. Backend save user profile in the database and generate our own **access token** for this user.
6. Backend send **access token** back to front end.
7. Backend use **access token** generated by ourselves to authorize following requests from front-end.

Refer to [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) for more information.  
You can use any connection tools like `axios`, `node-fetch`, `got`, ... to call Facebook Graph API.

Note: `request` library was deprecated, do not use this one. (Since Feb 11th 2020)
