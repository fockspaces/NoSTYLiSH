## Build Product APIs

### Create Tables Necessary

Look at all product APIs closely and carefully. It's your job to create appropriate tables in MySQL server to support all the APIs.

### Build Product Management Page

Build a simple web page we can access through `http://[YOUR_PUBLIC_ELASTIC_IP]/admin/product.html`. In this page, show a form for adding new product data which should include necessary text input fields and file fields for uploading product images.

### Build Product Create API for Management

Sometimes, you have to build API for internal use. It's time coming!  
Use [multer module](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) to handle file uploading.
